1. Plays like Fillomino, in which you have to guess areas on the board marked by their number.
2. In Tatamino, however, you only have areas 1, 2 and 3 tiles big.
3. Please remember two areas of the same number size can't be touching.
1. Each rectangle represents a mat(Tatami) which is of the same size. You must fill each Tatami with a number ranging from 1 to size.
2. Each number can appear only once in each Tatami.
3. In one row or column, each number must appear the same number of times.
4. You can't have two identical numbers touching horizontally or vertically.
