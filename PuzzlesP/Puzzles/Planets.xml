1. In Planets you are given an interesting Galaxy, where Suns only shine their light in horizontal and vertical lines.
2. On the board you can see the Planets of this Galaxy. Each Planet is lit on some side (or not lit at all).
3. You should place one Sun on each row and column, according to how the Planets are lit.
4. You should also place one Nebula on each row and column.
5. Nebulas block sunlight, so if there is a Nebula between a Sun and a Planet, the Planet won't be lit.
6. Finally, Planets block sunlight too. So if there is a Planet between a Sun and another Planet, the further Planet won't be lit by that Sun.
