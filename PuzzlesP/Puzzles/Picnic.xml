2. You brought your picnic basket (like everyone else) and your blanket (like everyone else).
3. The object is to make space for everyone and to leave the park open for walking around.
4. find a way to lay every picnic basket so that no blanket touches another one, horizontally or vertically.
5. Also the remaining park should be accessible to everyone, so empty grass spaces should form a single continuous area.
6. The number on top of the basket shows you how many tiles the basket must be flung.
