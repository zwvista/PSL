1. On the board there are a few number sets. Those numbers are sequences all starting from 1 up to a number N.
2. You should draw as many lines into the grid as number sets: a line starts with the number 1, goes through the numbers in order up to the highest, where it ends.
3. In doing this, you have to pass through all tiles on the board. Lines cannot cross.
