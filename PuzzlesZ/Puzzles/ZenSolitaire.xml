1. A favorite Zen Master pastime, scattering stones on the sand and picking them up.
2. You can start at any stone and pick it up (just to click on it and it will be numbered in the order you pick it up).
3. From a stone, you can move horizontally or vertically to the next stone. You can't jump over stones, if you encounter it, you have to pick it up.
4. When moving from a stone to another, you can change direction, but you cannot reverse it.
5. when a stone has been picked up, you can pass away it if you encounter it again (it's not there anymore).
6. The goal is to pick up every stone.
