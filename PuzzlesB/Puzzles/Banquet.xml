1. Join the tables in order to form "banquets" of at least two tables.
2. The number on the table tells you how many tiles it must be moved. Tables without numbers must stay put.
3. Tables can't cross other tables, nor cross other tables paths after they moved.
4. Banquets cannot touch each other horizontally or vertically (they can touch diagonally).
5. Banquets can't be L-shaped but can be more than one table wide.
