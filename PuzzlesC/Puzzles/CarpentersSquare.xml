1. Similar to Carpenter's Wall, this time you have to respect the same rules, but instead of forming a Nurikabe, you just have to divide the board into many.Capenter's Squares (L shaped tools) of different size.
2. The circled numbers on the board indicate the corner of the L.
3. When a number is inside the circle, that indicates the total number of squares occupied by the L.
4. The arrow always sits at the end of an arm and points to the corner of an L.
5. All the tiles in the board have to be part of a Carpenter's Square.
