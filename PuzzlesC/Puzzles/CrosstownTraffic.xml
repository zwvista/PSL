1. Draw a circuit (looping road)
2. The road may cross itself, but otherwise does not touch or retrace itself.
3. The numbers along the edge indicate the stretch of the nearest section of road from that point, in corresponding row or column.
4. For example if the first stretch of road is curve, straight and curve the number of that hint is 3.
5. Another example: if the first stretch of road is curve and curve, the number of that hint is 2.
6. Not all tiles should be used. In some levels some part of the board can remain unused.
