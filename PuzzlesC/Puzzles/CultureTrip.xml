2. During a Culture Trip, in order to make everybody happy, you devise a convoluted method to visit a city:
3. All neighborhoods must be visited exactly and only once.
4. You have to set foot in a neighborhood only once and can't come back after you leave it.
5. In a neighborhood, you either visit All Museums or All Monuments.
6. If you visit Monuments, you can't pass over Museums and vice-versa.
7. You have to alternate between neighborhoods where you visit Museums and those where you visit Monuments.
8. After visiting Museums, you should visit Monuments, then Museums again, etc.
9. The Trip must form a closed loop, in the end returning to the starting neighborhood.
