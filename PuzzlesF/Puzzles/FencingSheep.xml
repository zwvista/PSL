1. At the last game of Wildlife Football, Lemurs accused Giraffes of cheating, Monkeys ran away with the coin after the toss and Lions ate the ball.
2. So you're given the task to raise some fencing between the different species, while spirits cool down.
3. Fences should encompass at least one animal of a certain species, and all animals of a certain species must be in the same enclosure.
4. There can't be empty enclosures.
5. Where three or four fences meet, a fence post is put in place. On the Park all posts are already marked with a dot.
