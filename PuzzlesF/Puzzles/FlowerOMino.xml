1. You are a gardener. you've been employed by a sour weird lady.
2. This lady, after years of having her garden grow wild with flowers and without enclosures, decided that those are way too many flowers and too few enclosures.
3. So now being an avid fan of Tetris, she asked you to divide the garden in many Tetris shaped mini-gardens.
4. And while doing that they HAVE to tread, destroy and plow as many flowers as you can, provide you leave just the one in each Tetris mini-garden.
5. Divide the board in tetrominos (4-tile pieces). Each tetromino should have only one flower inside it.
