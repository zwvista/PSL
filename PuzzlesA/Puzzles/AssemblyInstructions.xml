1. Divide the board so that every letter corresponds to a 'part' which has the same shape and orientation everywhere it is found.
2. So for example if letter 'A' is a 2x3 rectangle, every 'A' on the board will correspond to a 2x3 rectangle and 'A' will appear in the same position in the rectangle itself.
3. If letter 'B' has an L shape with the letter on the top left, every 'B' will have an L shape with the letter on the top left, etc.
