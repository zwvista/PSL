1. Draw a loop that passes through each clear tile.
2. The loop must be a single one and can't intersect itself.
3. A number in a cell shows how many cell must be shaded around its four sides.
4. Not all cells that must be shaded are given with a hint. Two shaded cells can't touch orthogonally.
5. The loop must pass over every cell that hasn't got a number or has not been shaded.
