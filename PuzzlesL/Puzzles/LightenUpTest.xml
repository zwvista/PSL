1. What you see from above is a room and the marked squares are walls.
2. The goal is to put lightbulbs in the room so that all the blank(non-wall) squares are lit, following these rules.
3. Lightbulbs light all free, unblocked squares horizontally and vertically.
4. A lightbulb can't light another lightbulb.
5. Walls block light. Also walls with a number tell you how many lightbulbs are adjacent to it, horizontally and vertically.
6. Walls without a number can have any number of lightbulbs. However, lightbulbs don't need to be adjacent to a wall.
