1. The board represents a piece of land bought by a bunch of people. They decided to split the land in equal parts.
2. However some people are more social and some are less, so each owner wants an exact number of neighbours around him.
3. Each number on the board represents an owner house and the number of neighbours he desires.
4. Divide the land so that each one has an equal number of squares and the requested number of neighbours.
5. Later on, there will be Question Marks, which represents an owner for which you don't know the neighbours preference.
