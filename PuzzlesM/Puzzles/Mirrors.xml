1. The goal is to draw a single, continuous, non-crossing path that fills the entire board.
2. Some tiles are already given and can contain Mirrors, which force the path to make a turn. Other tiles already contain a fixed piece of straight path.
3. Your task is to fill the remaining board tiles with straight or 90 degree path lines, in the end connecting a single, continuous line.
4. Please note you can make 90 degree turn even there are no mirrors.  Variant
5. In the Maze variant, the path isn't closed. You have two spots on the board which represent the start and end of the path.
