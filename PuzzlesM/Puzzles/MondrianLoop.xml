1. Enough with impressionists, time for a nice geometric painting called Squarism!
2. Divide the board in many rectangles or squares. Each rectangle/square can contain only one number, which represents its area, but it can also contain none.
3. The rectangles/squares can't touch each other with their sides (they can't share a side), but they have to form a loop by connecting with their corners.
4. In the end there must be a single loop that connects all rectangles/squares by corners.
