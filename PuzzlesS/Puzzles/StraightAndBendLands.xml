1. This odd nation is divided into two types of regions. One where roads always turn on villages, and one where roads always go straight!
2. Draw a loop that goes through villages (houses), but avoid trees.
3. While passing on villages, the road might turn or not, but if it turns then the road will turn on all villages in that region.
4. Conversely if it goes straight, all villages of that region will have the road go straight through them.
