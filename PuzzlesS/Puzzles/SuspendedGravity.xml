1. Each region contains the number of stones, which can be indicated by a number.
2. Regions without a number contain at least one stone.
3. Stones inside a region are all connected either vertically or horizontally.
4. Stones in two adjacent regions cannot touch horizontally or vertically.
5. Lastly, if we apply gravity to the puzzle and the stones fall down to the bottom of the board they fit together exactly and cover the bottom half of the board.
6. Think "Tetris": all the blocks will fall as they are (they won't break into single stones)
