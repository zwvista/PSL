1. A mix between Nurikabe and Snake, with some rules from one game and some from the other.
2. Nurikabe Rules: Each number on the grid indicates a garden, occupying as many tiles as the number itself.
3. Gardens can have any form, extending horizontally and vertically but can't extend diagonally.
4. The gardens are separated by a single, continuous wall. This means all wall tiles on the board must be connected horizontally or vertically. There can't be isolated walls
5. Additionally, not all the gardens in the puzzle may be numbered at the start. There could be some hidden gardens.
6. The wall can't form 2x2 squares.
7. Snake Rules: Two circles are the head and tail of the snake (it is irrelevant which is which).
8. A snake can't touch its body orthogonally, but it CAN touch itself diagonally. However a snake head can touch its tail.
9. Snakes cannot cross each other.
