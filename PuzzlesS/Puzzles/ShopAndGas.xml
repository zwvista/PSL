1. In Shop & Gas you take the typical day at shopping. By the way: you just bought a new hyper-ecological car.
2. This car goes on a ultra-green combustible, which is the saviour of the environment. It costs close to zero, it does not pollute and is found in abundance everywhere.
3. The only small problem is that the car consumes about 10 liter per Km. Yes, that's a problem.
4. So while shopping you have to constantly refuel your car. Thus, Shop & Gas rules are as follows:
5. You start from your house. Right away, you're low on fuel so you must pass a fuel station.
6. All these prototype fuel stations are shaped like corners. Don't ask why. You just have to turn on those tiles.
7. Each time you pass a gas station, you then have to go shopping.
8. Shopping malls are a lot more consumer friendly and have straight roads. So you have to go straight on those tiles.
9. After a shopping mall you are almost empty again. The next thing you must pass is a gas station. Then shopping, gas, etc. 10.After you passed all the shopping malls and gas station, you have to go back to your house, forming a closed path. 11.The last thing you have to pass before going back home, is a gas station.
