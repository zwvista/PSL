1. A Snake is a path of five tiles, numbered 1-2-3-4-5, where 1 is the head and 5 the tail. The snake's body segments are connected horizontally or vertically.
2. A snake cannot see another snake or it would attack it. A snake sees straight in the direction 2-1, that is to say it sees in front of the number 1.
3. A snake cannot touch another snake horizontally or vertically.
4. Arrows show you the closest piece of Snake in that direction (before another arrow or the edge).
5. Arrows with zero mean that there is no Snake in that direction.
6. arrows block snake sight and also block other arrows hints.
